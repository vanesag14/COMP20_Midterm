                        Growing up, Vanesa enjoyed drinking a cafecito con
                        un pan dulce in the mornings with her family; it was a 
                        tradition. Her tia made the best pan, and now Vanesa 
                        is trying to share her tia's recipes to the world.

                        When Vanessa was younger, her mother would take her 
                        every week to her local pastelito shop, and let her pick 
                        out a few sweet treats. Naturally, she developed quite a 
                        taste for good Hispanic  pastries. When she moved to college 
                        from Miami to Boston, missing the Cuban pastries she used to 
                        eat as a kid, decided to spend her free time working part time 
                        at a Hispanic bakery a few blocks from her school. Eventually, 
                        with the help of her friends, she decided to open up her own shop, 
                        Pastelitos.
