        <h1>About us</h1>
        <p> Pastelitos is a small local minority-owned pastry shop in Boston ran 
            by four college students: Vanesa, Marianne, Vanessa, and Daniel.
            The four co-founders come from diverse backgrounds. Born in different parts 
            of the world, the team wants to share their delicious recipes with anyone 
            they come across with.

                    <p class="a">
                        Growing up, Vanesa enjoyed drinking a cafecito con
                        un pan dulce in the mornings with her family; it was a 
                        tradition. Her tia made the best pan, and now Vanesa 
                        is trying to share her tia's recipes to the world.

                        Vanesa is a junior at Tufts University studying Human Factors
                        Engineering and Computer Science. Though Vanesa is
                        a full time student, she works at Pastelitos to support 
                        her college career.

                    <p class="a">
                        For Marianneâ€™s grandma, making pan for special events and
                         holidays was something she took pride in. As Marianne was 
                         growing up, she was taught by her grandma to make pan just like
                          she had for years. She carries that tradition working for 
                          Pastelitos today.

                    <p class="a">
                        When Vanessa was younger, her mother would take her 
                        every week to her local pastelito shop, and let her pick 
                        out a few sweet treats. Naturally, she developed quite a 
                        taste for good Hispanic  pastries. When she moved to college 
                        from Miami to Boston, missing the Cuban pastries she used to 
                        eat as a kid, decided to spend her free time working part time 
                        at a Hispanic bakery a few blocks from her school. Eventually, 
                        with the help of her friends, she decided to open up her own shop, 
                        Pastelitos.
